clone - clones the repo to computer
add - moves file to staging area


Use "git checkout SHA" instead of "git reset HEAD"

Git workflow:

-first make sure that the directory you are working in is being tracked by git. If not use <git init>.

-whenever you modify a file add it to the staging area using <git add>.

-next after adding it once or multiple times, commit it using <git commit -m "put stuff here">.

-now for the last part, you need internet connection to push the changes you made onto your github repo using <git push url>.

-you can use <git clone url> to copy over a repo into a local directory.
